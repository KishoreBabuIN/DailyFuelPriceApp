# Daily Fuel Price Check 

A pretty basic android app to check the latest fuel prices in major India cities.

This project was bootstrapped using [kotlin-android-started](https://github.com/ravidsrk/kotlin-android-starter)

The prices shown are those returned by [fuel_price_india](https://github.com/tekina/fuel_prices_india) - likely Indian Oil.
